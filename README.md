# portfolio 
Hi! I'm just starting out as a software Engineer and I'm very excited to be continuing the journey!
I had a lot of fun with my first project. It was very interesting to see all the things I've learned so far at work.
When uploading these files, I did run into a bit of an issue. My friend, who is also a student, was logged in previously and for some rest it says their name instead of mine.
Thank you for taking the time to look at my first portfolio website!
