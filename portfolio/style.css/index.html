                    <h3>About Tatium</h3><!--next section-->
                    <p>I have taught preschool for a few years now, and while I love my students and being able to help build their futures, I've always been interested in advancing in other careers. When I heard about Thinkful, I knew it was something I would be interested in!</p>
                    <p>I really enjoy still being able to build and create things and learn and help teach others in different ways. Software development has given me a new passion and I'm excited to share that with the world! So, if you're looking for a new software engineer, feel free to reach out!</p>
